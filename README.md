### Grpc examples from grpc.io

Here are example taken from grpc.io, kept for my reference. Just trying to figure out who this grpc things work out. 
Just this grpc is not intutive to me, i know those optimization, less bandwidth, types and things, but things can be made easy to parse.
Even when trying to learn, it's just not intutive.

For who trying to learn, go to each folder and try examples, instruction are in each folder with readme.
